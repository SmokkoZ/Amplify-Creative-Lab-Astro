<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Map Pack Dominance</strong> — You must rank in the top 3 on Google Maps for your main keywords to capture walk-in traffic.</li>
    <li><strong>Review Velocity Matters</strong> — A steady stream of new reviews signals to Google that your venue is currently popular and open.</li>
    <li><strong>Specific Cuisine Keywords</strong> — Don't be generic. Optimize for specific dishes that people travel to Vic Park for (e.g., "Vegan Ramen").</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Menu Usability</strong> — 88% of local searches lead to a visit. Ensure your menu loads instantly on mobile data.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<h3>1. The Albany Highway Battlefield</h3>
<p>
  Victoria Park is famous for having one of the longest continuous strips of restaurants in the Southern Hemisphere. Ideally, this means huge foot traffic. Realistically, it means <strong>huge competition</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  When a potential customer stands on the corner of Duncan Street and Albany Highway and types "dinner" into their phone, Google has over 50 options to show them within 500 metres. If your SEO isn't dialed in, you are invisible.
</p>

<h3>2. Optimizing for "Near Me" Searches</h3>
<p>
  Data shows that <strong>88% of searches for "restaurants near me" result in a visit within 24 hours</strong>. For Vic Park, this window is often within 24 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  To capture this traffic:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Claim and Verify</strong> your Google Business Profile (GBP) perfectly.</li>
  <li><strong>Category Selection:</strong> Don't just pick "Restaurant". Pick "Authentic Japanese Restaurant", "Ramen Restaurant", and "Asian Fusion Restaurant".</li>
  <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Tick every box that applies: "Outdoor Seating", "Kid Friendly", "Dog Friendly". These are filters users apply.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. The Power of Reviews</h3>
<p>
  In a dense strip, social proof is the tie-breaker. If you have 4.2 stars and the place next door has 4.7, you lose.
</p>
<p>
  Implement a strategy to generate reviews <em>while the customer is happy</em>. A simple QR code on the payment counter asking "Love your meal? Tell the neighbours!" can increase review volume by 50%. Remember, "Recency" is a ranking factor—Google prefers 10 reviews from this month over 50 from two years ago.
</p>

<h3>4. Structured Data for Menus</h3>
<p>
  Google can't "read" a photo of your menu. It can read <strong>Schema.org structured data</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  By marking up your menu in your website code, you allow Google to highlight your dishes in search results. If someone searches "best burger Vic Park", and your structured data explicitly lists a "Double Smash Burger", Google is much more likely to serve your site as the answer.
