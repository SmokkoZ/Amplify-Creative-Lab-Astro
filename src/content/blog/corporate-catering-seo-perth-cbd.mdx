  - question: "How critical is site speed for CBD venues?"
    answer: "Crucial. The CBD lunch break is time-compressed. If your menu takes 10 seconds to load on 4G in a elevator, you've lost the order."
  - question: "What is the best way to sell catering online?"
    answer: "A dedicated e-commerce flow. Don't make people email a PDF form. Let them select platters, choose delivery times, and pay by corporate card instantly."
  - question: "How do I target specific office buildings?"
    answer: "Use location-based keywords in your blog or landing pages. e.g., 'Best coffee near QV1' or 'Lunch delivery to Brookfield Place'."
  - question: "Should I offer corporate accounts?"
    answer: "Yes. Allowing businesses to have a login with monthly invoicing (or saved company cards) removes friction and encourages repeat bulk orders."
  - question: "Is SEO worth it for a small coffee shop?"
    answer: "Yes, focused SEO. Ranking for 'coffee meeting St Georges Terrace' can bring in high-value business meetings, not just $5 latte sales."

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Speed is Currency</strong> — For time-poor office workers, a fast, mobile-optimized site is the difference between a sale and an exit.</li>
    <li><strong>Frictionless Catering</strong> — Implement "Add to Cart" functionality for platters and boardroom lunches. PDF forms are a barrier.</li>
    <li><strong>Building-Specific SEO</strong> — Target the big towers (Brookfield, QV1, Central Park) with specific location keywords.</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate Accounts</strong> — Enable features that suit the B2B buyer: tax invoices, cost centres, and repeat orders.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>1. The 12pm - 2pm Sprint</h3>
<p>
  In Perth CBD, the majority of daily revenue is made in two short windows: the morning coffee run and the 12pm lunch rush.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Office workers in Perth CBD spend an average of $15-$20 on lunch</strong>, often daily. To capture this recurring revenue, your digital experience must be seamless. Pre-ordering apps or a reliable, fast mobile website that allows "Order Ahead" can revolutionize your throughput during peak hours.
</p>

<h3>2. Mastering Corporate Catering</h3>
<p>
  While the $15 lunch is good, the $500 boardroom platter is better.
</p>
<p>
  Many CBD venues fail because they treat catering as an afterthought—a hidden PDF link in the footer. 
  <strong>Catering should be a primary navigation item.</strong> It requires an e-commerce interface where an EA can:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visualise the platter (high-quality photos).</li>
  <li>Select dietary specifics (Gluten Free, Vegan signs).</li>
  <li>Choose exact delivery windows.</li>
  <li>Receive an instant Tax Invoice for expense claims.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Hyper-Local Tower SEO</h3>
<p>
  "Perth CBD" is too broad. You want to own your block.
</p>
<p>
  Optimise for micro-locations. If you are at the bottom of St Georges Terrace, use keywords related to "Elizabeth Quay" or "The Esplanade". If you are near the mines, target "West end lunch spots".
</p>
<p>
  <em>Example Strategy:</em> Create a targeted page or blog post titled "The Best Business Lunch Spots near Brookfield Place", featuring your venue.
</p>

<h3>4. Reliability is Your Brand</h3>
<p>
  For corporate clients, reliability trumps novelty. If a lunch is 10 minutes late, a meeting is ruined.
</p>
<p>
  Your website should communicate reliability. Display clear "Average Review" scores, feature logos of corporate clients you serve (social proof), and have a clear, visible phone number for "Urgent Enquiries".
