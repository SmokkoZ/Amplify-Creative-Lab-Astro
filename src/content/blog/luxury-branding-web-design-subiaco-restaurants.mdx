faq:
  - question: "What defines a 'luxury' website design?"
    answer: "Luxury design is defined by whitespace, typography, and imagery. It avoids clutter, uses high-fidelity photography, and ensures seamless, almost invisible functionality."
  - question: "How important is corporate catering for Subiaco sites?"
    answer: "Critical. With high office density, a dedicated 'Corporate Functions' or 'Catering' page with downloadable PDFs and quick-order forms can add 30% to your revenue."
  - question: "Should I show prices on my fine dining website?"
    answer: "Yes. Transparency builds trust. Even for high-end venues, potential guests (and corporate EAs booking lunches) need to know the price bracket to qualify themselves."
  - question: "Does my site need to integrate with concierge services?"
    answer: "It can be beneficial. Top-tier Subiaco venues often benefit from backend integrations that allow hotel concierges in nearby CBD/West Perth to book tables easily for guests."
  - question: "How do I market private dining rooms?"
    answer: "Use 360-degree virtual tours or high-quality video walkthroughs. Private dining is booked on 'vibe' and capacity, so clarity is key."

<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Digital Elegance</strong> — Your website is the first course. If it looks cheap or cluttered, guests assume the food will be too.</li>
    <li><strong>Target the Corporate EA</strong> — Executive Assistants book the big tables. Make their job easy with "Function Packs" and clear capacity info.</li>
    <li><strong>Seamless Reservations</strong> — Use integrated systems like SevenRooms that keep the user on your branded site, rather than jarring redirects.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Consistency</strong> — Your font, colour, and tone on the web must match the menu on the table perfectly.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<h3>1. The Subiaco Standard</h3>
<p>
  Subiaco has long held the title of Perth's upscale dining precinct. With a clientele that includes corporate executives, politicians, and discerning foodies, the standard for presentation is incredibly high.
</p>
<p>
  A potential guest willing to spend $150+ per head will judge your venue before they arrive. If your website is slow, broken on mobile, or aesthetically dated, you lose the booking to a competitor on Rokeby Road who looks the part.
</p>

<h3>2. Designing for the Corporate Account</h3>
<p>
  Unlike Northbridge (nightlife) or Fremantle (tourism), <strong>Subiaco is powered by the business lunch</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Statistics show that the <strong>average transaction value</strong> for corporate bookings in Subiaco is significantly higher than private dining. To capture this market, your website needs to speak to the Executive Assistant (EA) who is organizing the booking.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Essential Features for Corporate Conversion:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Downloadable Function Packs:</strong> Beautifully designed PDFs available one click away.</li>
  <li><strong>Private Room Specs:</strong> Clear photos, seating capacities (boardroom vs. cocktail style), and AV capabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Dietary Matrix:</strong> Quick assurance that you can handle the CEO's gluten intolerance and the client's vegan requirement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. The Role of Typography and Whitespace</h3>
<p>
  Luxury is often defined by what isn't there. Low-end websites are cluttered with pop-ups, banners, and dense text. High-end websites breathe.
</p>
<p>
  We utilize <strong>serif typography</strong> and generous whitespace to create a sense of calm and exclusivity. This "digital plating" mirrors the care your chef puts into plating a dish. It signals confidence.
</p>

<h3>4. Photography: The Hero Ingredient</h3>
<p>
  Your food photography must be magazine-quality. In Subiaco, grainy phone snaps on a website are a brand risk. We recommend investing in a quarterly professional shoot to keep your "Latest Menu" visuals fresh and seasonal.
</p>
<p>
  Video headers showing the slow pour of a vintage red wine or the plating of a signature dish invoke a sensory response that static images cannot match.
