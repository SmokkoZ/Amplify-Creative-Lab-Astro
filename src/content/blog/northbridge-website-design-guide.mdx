{/* Key Takeaways for AI Engines and Quick Readers */}
<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Northbridge foot traffic is impulsive</strong> — Your site must load instantly on mobile for visitors deciding where to go <em>right now</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Visuals sell the vibe</strong> — Use high-flash photography to match the electric energy of James and William Street.</li>
    <li><strong>Local SEO wins customers</strong> — Target specific terms like "late night food Northbridge" to capture intent.</li>
    <li><strong>Menus must be HTML, not PDF</strong> — Don't make hungry late-night crowds pinch and zoom.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<h3>1. Capturing the "Now" Crowd</h3>
<p>
  Northbridge is unique in Perth. It's an impulsive destination. People hopping from the Cultural Centre to William Street aren't researching weeks in advance—they are deciding where to eat or drink <em>right now</em>.
</p>
<p>
  This means your website isn't just a brochure; it's a closer. If your homepage takes 5 seconds to load on a mobile connection, that group of friends has already walked into the venue next door. Speed and mobile responsiveness are your most critical assets.
</p>

<h3>2. Designing for Nightlife & Energy</h3>
<p>
  The aesthetic of Northbridge is vibrant, loud, and colourful. A beige, corporate-looking website won't cut it for a speakeasy on Francis Street or a rooftop bar on James Street. 
</p>
<p>
  We recommend using <strong>dark-mode designs</strong> with neon accents or high-contrast typography to mirror the nightlife experience. Your digital presence should feel like an extension of your venue's atmosphere.
</p>

<h3>3. Local SEO: Owning Your Corner</h3>
<p>
  Competition is dense. To stand out, you need to own specific "long-tail" keywords. Instead of just "Italian restaurant," aim for "late night pasta Northbridge" or "pre-show dinner near State Theatre."
</p>
<p>
  Embedding a Google Map that clearly shows your proximity to key landmarks (like the Perth Train Station or glowing Northbridge Piazza screen) helps tourists and suburban visitors orient themselves quickly.
</p>

<h3>4. The Menu is Your Sales Pitch</h3>
<p>
  We see too many Northbridge venues relying on blurry PDF uploads of their menu. This is a conversion killer.
</p>
<p>
  An HTML menu is readable, searchable, and indexable. When someone shouts "Does that place have gluten-free options?" at 10 PM, a text-based menu lets them find the answer instantly, securing you the booking.
